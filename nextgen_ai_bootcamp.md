Context:
A 3-month AI-ready coding bootcamp for freshmen and early university students in Senegal, aiming to identify and train high-agency young developers.
The page’s goal is to capture leads (email + phone number) and create excitement for the program.

🎯 GOAL

Design a sleek, cinematic one-page landing with a hero section, a simple form, and a minimal footer.
It should feel like a top-tier design agency built it — futuristic, confident, and aspirational — while staying ultra-light and fast.

🎨 DESIGN DIRECTION

Visual Identity:

Background: The existing dark silk shader animation stays as the hero background. It should feel alive, like a subtle “AI pulse.”

Style: Modern minimalism (geometry, clean grid, precise typography).

Typography:

Headings → Space Grotesk or Clash Display (bold, tech-artistic vibe).

Body → Inter or Jakarta Sans (clean, readable, modern).

Layout:

Hero (100vh) — Full viewport with shader background and central column layout (headline + subtext + form).

Form Section.

Footer.

Motion:

Soft fade-in for text (Framer Motion or GSAP).

Floating shimmer or pulse on the CTA button.

Form fields animate in sequentially.

Smooth scroll reveal (opacity + translateY).

Optional: slight parallax movement of text vs shader background.

✍️ COPY & STRUCTURE
🦋 HERO SECTION

Headline:
“Build the Future. Become an AI-Ready Developer.”

Subheadline:
Join a 3-month intensive coding bootcamp for freshmen and early university students in Senegal.
Learn modern software development, AI fundamentals, and real-world project building.

CTA/Form:

Minimal inline form: [Email] [Phone Number] [→ Register]

Placeholder text:

Email → “Enter your email”

Phone → “+221…”

Button: “Apply Now”

Below form (small text):
“Limited seats. Pre-selection applies.”

Optional secondary link: “Learn more (coming soon)” → smooth scroll or disabled for now.

💡 FOOTER

“© [Year] [Bootcamp Name]. Powered by [Your Company Name].
Building Africa’s next generation of AI developers.”

Include small social icons (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, GitHub).

Hover color: electric green.

🧠 TONE & COPY STYLE

Short, confident, forward-looking sentences.

Mix English with light bilingual hints if needed (e.g., “Formation gratuite — sélection sur motivation.”).

Avoid hype words; focus on purpose, mastery, and opportunity.

Example tagline variations:

“Learn. Build. Transform.”

“Code the future — from Senegal to the world.”

“Where Africa’s next generation of engineers begin.”

⚙️ INTERACTION DETAILS

Form submits asynchronously (Supabase, Airtable, or Email API).

On submit → small success animation:
“✅ You’re in. We’ll contact you soon.” (fade up)

Optional micro-animation: input border glow on focus (green).

Make button feel tactile: subtle scale + shadow on hover.
